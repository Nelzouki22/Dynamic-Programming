# Dynamic-Programming
 given positive number ‘n’, determine the maximum sum of any contiguous sub-array of size ‘n’ in a given array of positive integers.
For its solution, first, find all the sub-arrays of size ‘n’ and add the numbers in them each time. Further, compare and return the maximum sum out of the calculated sums. Here’s its coding implementation in C++
